        <h1> Haroon Aaron Dean </h1>
        <h3> My purpose </h3>
        <p class="about-me"> I do things to bring people together so they can grow. That’s my big “why” that’s been
          apparent at every stage of my life. Whether that”do” means building, hosting, or connecting — it’s gotta be so
          folks can come together.</p>

        <h3> A thing or a few lines about me </h3>
        <p class="about-me"> I’m curious. I get excited about building things that make people feel less alone and
          alienated in the world. My favorite way of learning is learning from people. Sitting in a conversation where I
          can just shut up and listen to someone speak at length about something they’re passionate or recently learned
          about is one of my favorite past-times. I also love listening to music and witnessing beautiful art.

          <br /> <br /> A small glimpse of my dedication to learning and curiosity is seen in my career: I studied
          Comparative
          Literature (with an emphasis in Arabic) at UC Berkeley before I moved onto work as a software engineer at
          different startups ranging from seed to Series C. Currently working on <a href="https://chaiandvibes.com">Chai
            and Vibes</a> with some friends, and that's the baby that has my attention right now. Previously worked on
          <a href="https://www.letsmakemoves.xyz">Make Moves</a>
        </p>
